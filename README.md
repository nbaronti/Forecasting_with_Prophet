**Question 1:** Did the Google search traffic increase during the month that MercadoLibre released its financial results?
**Answer:** Yes, the total search traffic in May 2020 (the month financials results were released) was greater than the median monthly search traffic across all months. Additionally, there appears to be some higher than normal traffic around 5/05 & 05/06 of 2020.

**Question 1:** Does any day-of-week effect that you observe concentrate in just a few hours of that day?
**Answer:** It appears the most traffic is Monday through Friday during hours 16 through 21 when looking at Eastern Time zone values (i.e., 4pm through 9pm EST)

**Question 2:** Does the search traffic tend to increase during the winter holiday period (weeks 40 through 52)?
**Answer:** Overall, the search traffic is lower (on average) during the winter holiday period (when compared to earlier weeks in the year).  However, there is a jump in search traffic during winter months when compared against weeks 35 - 40.

## Section 3

**Question 1:** Do both time series indicate a common trend thatâ€™s consistent with this narrative?
**Answer:** No, the average search trend remains relatively consistent throughout the 6 month period with a slight decrease in average searches throughout April to June.  On the other hand, the stock price recovered significantly from April through June with a positive trend upward.  There is also missing data from late February through Early March.

**Correlation Matrix**

**Question 2:** Does a predictable relationship exist between the lagged search traffic and the stock volatility or between the lagged search traffic and the stock price returns?
**Answer:** There is slight inverse relationship between search traffic and stock volatility, however not incredibly meaningful.  The -.15 inverse relationship would be worth digging into a bit further.  There is no meaningful relationship betwen hourly stock return and lagged search trends (i.e., less than .02 positive relationship).
